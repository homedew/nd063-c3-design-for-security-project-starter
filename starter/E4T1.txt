# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
Limit SSH Access to Trusted IPs: Restrict SSH access in security groups to specific IP addresses.
Use SSM Session Manager for SSH: Disable direct SSH, using AWS Systems Manager to improve security.
Implement Fail2Ban or AWS WAF: Use Fail2Ban to block repeated failed logins or configure AWS WAF rules.
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
Apply Least Privilege IAM Roles: Grant only necessary permissions, ensuring instances don’t have access to the “Secret Recipes” bucket.
Enforce S3 Bucket Policies and Conditions: Restrict bucket access with IAM role conditions or trusted VPC endpoints.
Enable S3 Encryption and Logging: Encrypt data in S3 and enable access logging for visibility into access attempts
