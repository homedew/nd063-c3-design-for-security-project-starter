1. Findings Related to the Brute Force Attack:
GuardDuty detected an SSH brute force attack targeting the application serverâ€™s SSH port due to repeated, unauthorized login attempts.
2. How GuardDuty Detected the Attack:
VPC Flow Logs: GuardDuty analyzed network traffic and identified suspicious, high-frequency login attempts.

AWS CloudTrail Logs: If there were attempts using unauthorized IAM credentials, GuardDuty flagged unusual API access.
Threat Intelligence Feeds: GuardDuty used AWS threat intelligence to detect IPs and patterns known for brute force attacks.

Seems like my Guardduty didnt show anything, but from my guess as above is current issue.
