1. Scan Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates
Tool: Checkov
Description: Checkov is an open-source IaC scanner that inspects infrastructure code (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform) for security and compliance issues, ensuring configurations follow best practices before deployment.
Example Vulnerability: Publicly Accessible Security Groups
Description: Checkov can detect security groups that allow unrestricted inbound access on specific ports (e.g., SSH on port 22), which could expose the environment to unauthorized access.
2. Scan AMIs or Containers for OS Vulnerabilities
Tool: Amazon Inspector
Description: Amazon Inspector scans Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and container images for known vulnerabilities, using a continuously updated database of security advisories.
Example Vulnerability: Outdated Software Packages
Description: Inspector might flag old versions of packages like OpenSSL or Apache with known vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit if left unpatched.
3. Scan an AWS Environment for Cloud Configuration Vulnerabilities
Tool: Prowler
Description: Prowler is an open-source tool that audits AWS configurations against best practices and compliance frameworks (e.g., CIS benchmarks, GDPR).
Example Vulnerability: Unrestricted S3 Bucket Access
Description: Prowler can identify S3 buckets that are publicly accessible or lack encryption, highlighting configurations that could lead to data exposure.
